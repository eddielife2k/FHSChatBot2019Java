# FHSChatBot2019Java
The Franklin High School Computer Club has created this GitHub in order to allow club members to add code to the project as they see fit. Computer Club members can also contribute by stating their ideas during club meetings.
# Main Executable (MainExecutable.java)
The "Magpie" AP Lab is created for the College Board APCS
curriculum by Laurie White.
This program has been altered and expanded by members of the 2019-2020 FHS Computer Club.
This the main executeable which will serve the chatbot by allowing it to greet the user, and say farewell.
Other ideas will be placed in separate files and will be called using this executable.
# ChatBot Responses Hub (FHSChatbot.java)
This file serves as the main hub for all responses our chatbot can process.
If it cannot answer a question, a response will allow users to refer their questions to administration.
